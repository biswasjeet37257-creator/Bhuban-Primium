Bhuban UI



🎬 Master Class Prompt: The "Bhuban World" Opening Sequence

Objective: A 3-to-5 second high-energy splash screen animation that transitions into the main app dashboard.

1. The Core Concept: "The Lens Flare"

The animation follows a journey from a Pink film strip (the creator) to the Yellow 'B' (the platform) to the Red 'Live' world (the audience).

2. Phase-by-Phase Technical Breakdown

Phase I: The Spark (0.0s – 1.0s)

• Visual: A blank off-white screen (#FFFDE7). Suddenly, a Pink (#F06292) film strip snakes into the frame from the left with a "whip-pan" motion.

• Action: The squares within the film strip pulse with Sunset Yellow (#FFB74D) light, as if "loading" energy.

• Physics: Use "Elastic Out" easing. The strip should overshoot its position and snap back.

Phase II: The Brand Manifestation (1.0s – 2.2s)

• Visual: The film strip circles the center of the screen, morphing into a liquid trail. This trail "pours" into the shape of the 3D "B".

• Action: The "B" grows from the center using a Squash and Stretch principle. It starts small and wide, then shoots up into its thick, bold form.

• Color Shift: A gradient sweep passes over the "B," transitioning from Vibrant Red (#E91E63) at the base to Yellow at the top.

Phase III: The Expansion (2.2s – 3.5s)

• Visual: The "B" emits a circular shockwave (the "Bhuban Ripple").

• Action: The shockwave clears the screen of the splash background. As the ripple expands, it reveals the UI (User Interface) underneath—thumbnails, the search bar, and user avatars—appearing like they are being "painted" on.

• Camera: A subtle "Z-axis" zoom-out to give the user the feeling of entering a vast world.

3. Motion Design Specifications (The "Math")

To ensure a "Master Class" finish, provide these specs to your developer:

• Frame Rate: 60fps (for liquid-smooth motion).

• Easing Curves:

• Entrance: f(t) = \text{cubic-bezier}(0.68, -0.6, 0.32, 1.6)

• Exit: f(t) = \text{cubic-bezier}(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

• Lighting: Implement a "Inner Glow" on the B using a soft Pink light to give it a 3D, tactile feel.

• Audio (The "Earcon"): A short, 3-note ascending melody. A "pop" sound when the film strip appears, a "hum" as the B forms, and a "shimmer/whoosh" as the UI reveals.

4. Implementation Master Prompt (Copy/Paste this)



"Animate a professional mobile app splash screen for 'Bhuban'. Start with a minimalist off-white background. Feature a stylized film strip in Pink (#F06292) that morphs dynamically into a bold, 3D 'B' logo in Sunset Yellow (#FFB74D). The animation style is 'Flat-Graphic-Liquid'. Use heavy squash-and-stretch physics. On the logo's final beat, trigger a radial ripple effect in Vibrant Red (#E91E63) that reveals a video-sharing grid UI. High energy, premium motion graphics, 4K resolution, 60fps."







🛑 The Bhuban Core Functional Blueprint

1. Navigation & Entry Points

• Home Icon: The "Universe" of content.

• Function: Resets the algorithm feed. A "tap" scrolls to the top; a "double tap" refreshes the cache for new recommendations.

• Logic: Uses a Weighted Random Forest Algorithm to mix subscribed content with new discoveries.

• Bhuban Shorts: High-velocity, vertical content.

• Function: Full-screen immersive player. Swipe up for next, swipe down for previous.

• Logic: Prefetches the next two videos in the background to ensure zero-latency playback.

• Upload Bar (+) : The Creation Hub.

• Function: Opens a bottom sheet with three options: Go Live, Upload Video, or Create a Short.

• Animation: The + icon rotates 45 degrees to become an X when open.

2. User Lifecycle (Identity & Access)

• Sign-Up / Sign-In (Authentication):

• Function: OAuth 2.0 integration. Allows "One-Tap" login via Gmail or Apple ID.

• Condition: On the first sign-up, the user is prompted to select 3 "Interests" to seed the initial algorithm.

• Profile & Settings:

• Function: The "Mission Control." Includes Profile Accessibility (Dark Mode, Font Size, Screen Reader support) and Privacy Settings.

• Logout: Clears local session tokens but keeps the "Watch History" synced to the cloud for the next login.

3. The Video Experience (Playback & Interaction)

• Resolution & Quality:

• Function: Auto-switching based on bandwidth (from 144p to 8K).

• Logic: Uses HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) to fragment video files, preventing buffering.

• Interaction Suite:

• Like: A "Pink-to-Red" heart explosion animation. Adds the video to the "Liked Videos" library.

• Comment: A nested thread system. The algorithm boosts "High-Value" comments (those liked by the Creator).

• Share: Generates a short URL and opens the native OS share sheet.

• Subscribe: The most critical button.

• Effect: Transitions from a "Solid Pink" button to a "Transparent Gray" button with a bell icon.

4. Creator Studio (The Engine)

• Video Upload Logic:

• Step 1: Metadata (Title, Description, Tags).

• Step 2: Thumbnail selection (Auto-generated or Manual upload).

• Step 3: Copyright Check (Automatic scanning of audio/video ID).

• Creator Tools:

• Analytics: Real-time graph showing Views, Watch Time, and Revenue.

• Audience Insights: Shows when your subscribers are most active on Bhuban.

5. Algorithmic Logic (The "Brain")

• Recommendation Engine: * Working Condition: It calculates the Click-Through Rate (CTR) multiplied by Average View Duration (AVD).

• The "Bhuban Spike": If a video gets 100 likes in 10 minutes, the algorithm pushes it to the "Trending" page globally.

• Channel Profile: A structured panel containing:

• Home: Featured video.

• Videos: Sorted by "Latest" or "Popular."

• Community: Text/Image posts for fan engagement.

🛑 Bug-Check & Error Handling Analysis

I have audited the logic above. Here are the potential "Bugs" and the Bhuban Solution:



💎 The Bhuban Master Class: Advanced Systems & AI Integration

1. The "Bhuban Brain" (AI & Machine Learning Formulas)

You don't just want a list; you want the math that drives engagement.

A. The Engagement Score (E):

To decide what goes on the Home Screen, the AI simulates the value of a video using this formula:



Image.png





• V = View Duration Percentage

• C = Click-Through Rate (CTR)

• S = Social Shares

• D = Decay Factor (How old the video is)

• w = Specific weights adjusted by your AI in real-time.

B. Neural Network Integration:

• Computer Vision (CV): Every frame is scanned during upload to detect "Yellow/Pink/Red" aesthetic markers to promote your brand style.

• NLP (Natural Language Processing): AI generates auto-captions and translates them into 50+ languages instantly, making Bhuban "The World" platform.

2. Structured Instructional Method (The Developer Pipeline)

To ensure no bugs occur during the build, follow the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) method:

1. Atomic Design: Build the smallest elements (the Pink 'Like' button) first, then the card, then the page.

2. Containerization: Use Docker. If the code works on your computer, it must work on the server.

3. Stress Simulation: Before launching, use "Chaos Engineering" (simulating a server crash) to see if the platform stays online.

3. Possible "Bugs" (The Horror Stories) & Solutions

In a video platform, these are the three "Silent Killers":

Problem A: The "Thundering Herd" Effect

• Scenario: A famous creator uploads a video. 10 million people click it at the exact same second. The server explodes.

• Solution: Edge Computing (CDNs). Host the video on servers physically close to the user (e.g., if the user is in Dhaka, the video serves from a Dhaka-based cache).

Problem B: Aspect Ratio Distortion

• Scenario: A user uploads a 4:3 vintage video, and it looks stretched on a 16:9 phone.

• Solution: AI-Letterboxing. The AI detects the resolution and automatically blurs the background with your brand's Pink/Yellow gradient to fill the gaps.

Problem C: Audio-Video Out of Sync

• Scenario: The lips move, but the sound comes 2 seconds later.

• Solution: PTS (Presentation Time Stamp) Correction. Your player must prioritize the audio clock over the video clock to force the frames to catch up.

4. The "Omniscient" Debugging Protocol

How to fix anything in 3 steps:

• Step 1: Telemetry (The Look): Use a dashboard (like Grafana) to see "Heartbeats" of your servers. If the Pink line drops, the server is down.

• Step 2: Log Aggregation (The Clue): Use AI to scan millions of lines of code logs to find the "Exception."

• Step 3: Blue-Green Deployment (The Fix): Never fix the "Live" app. Create a "Green" version (the fix), test it, and then instantly swap the "Blue" (broken) version out.

5. AI Simulation for UX Testing

Instead of hiring 1,000 testers, use Agentic AI Simulation:

• Deploy 5,000 "AI Bots" with different personalities (e.g., "The Fast Scroller," "The Commenter," "The Slow Internet User").

• Let them use Bhuban for 24 hours.

• The Result: The AI gives you a "Heatmap" showing exactly where users get bored or where buttons are hard to click.

6. The "Bhuban Guard" (Safety & Security)

• Problem: Video Piracy (people downloading your videos illegally).

• Solution: Dynamic Watermarking. The AI invisibly embeds the viewer's IP address into the video. If they leak it, you know exactly who did it. 



📊 The Bhuban Creator Studio: Advanced Analytical Architecture

1. The Real-Time Command Center (Dashboard)

The first thing a creator sees. This must be a "low-latency" environment.

• Live Pulse: A real-time ticker of views and "Likes" occurring in the last 60 minutes.

• The "Performance vs. Typical" Metric: This compares the current video’s first 24 hours against the creator's average.

• Visual: A green "up" arrow if overperforming, a gray "flat" dash if normal, and a red "down" warning if underperforming.

2. Deep-Dive Metrics (The "Science" of Growth)

• Audience Retention Curve: A frame-by-frame graph showing where viewers stay and where they leave.

• The "Spike" Analysis: If the graph spikes, the AI highlights that section and says: "Viewers are re-watching this part—consider making more content like this."

• The "Dip" Analysis: If the graph drops sharply in the first 30 seconds, the system flags: "Your intro is too long; try a hook within the first 5 seconds."

• Traffic Source Breakdown: Shows exactly where views come from: Bhuban Search, External (WhatsApp/Facebook), or the Algorithm Feed.

• CTR (Click-Through Rate) vs. Impressions: This measures "Thumbnail Effectiveness."

• Formula: \text{CTR} = \left( \frac{\text{Clicks}}{\text{Impressions}} \right) \times 100.

3. AI-Driven "Creator Intelligence" (The Innovative Edge)

This is where Bhuban beats the competition. We integrate AI to act as a personal consultant.

• Content Gap Finder: The AI scans what your subscribers are searching for but cannot find on your channel, then suggests: "Your audience is searching for 'Advanced Coding'—you haven't made a video on this yet."

• Predictive Revenue: Uses historical data to predict how much money the video will make over the next 30 days.

• A/B Thumbnail Testing (Built-in): Creators upload two thumbnails. The app shows Version A to 50% of people and Version B to 50% for one hour, then automatically picks the winner based on the highest CTR.

4. Technical Working Conditions & Bug Debugging

To ensure this function works in any condition, we implement a "Fault-Tolerant" data pipeline.

Potential Problems & Solutions



How to Debug "Ghost Data"

If a creator reports their analytics are wrong:

1. Check the "Event Log": See if the video-viewing "ping" reached the server.

2. Verify the "Sync ID": Ensure the mobile app and desktop site are looking at the same server cluster.

3. Trace the Session: Use Timeline Debugging to see the exact path of a single view from "Click" to "Database Entry."

5. My Innovative Thoughts for "Bhuban"

To make the app more user-friendly, consider these Bhuban-Exclusive features:

• The "Collaborator Score": An analytics page specifically for "Collab" videos that shows which creator brought more audience to the other.

• Dark-Mode "Eye-Saver" Analytics: High-contrast graphs designed for creators who check their stats at 2 AM.

• Voice Analytics: A "Siri-like" feature where a creator can ask: "Hey Bhuban, how is my latest video doing?" and the app speaks back: "It’s doing 20% better than your last one, mostly with viewers from London."

Final Master Instruction:

For your developers, I recommend the "Micro-Frontend" approach for the Creator Studio. This keeps the "Viewer App" and the "Creator App" in one package but separates their code so that a bug in the Analytics won't crash the Video Player





🛠️ The Bhuban Creator Studio: Full Functional Architecture

1. The Real-Time View-Count Engine

Description: This function provides creators with an instant "heartbeat" of their video's performance. It must show views, likes, and watch time within 2-5 seconds of the event happening.

• The Problem: If you update your main SQL database for every single view, the server will "lock up" and crash under high traffic (The Write-Heavy Bottleneck).

• The Solution: Use an Asynchronous Stream-Processing Architecture.

• Logic: When a user watches a video, the app sends a "ping" to a Message Queue (like Apache Kafka).

• Processing: A worker service (like Spark or Flink) aggregates these pings in memory and updates the main database in "batches" every 30 seconds.

• Debug Method: If views are frozen, check the Queue Depth. If the queue is full, your "Workers" are down or too slow.

2. Audience Retention & "Heatmap" Analysis

Description: A broad graphical representation of where viewers drop off or re-watch specific segments of a video.

• Instructional Method: * The video player sends a heartbeat every 5 seconds: [VideoID, UserID, Timestamp, CurrentPlayhead].

• AI Simulation: The AI clusters this data to find "anomalies."

• Result: If 80% of users skip from 01:00 to 01:45, the Creator Studio flags this as a "Dead Zone" and suggests better editing for the next video.

• Working Condition: Must function even if the user has a spotty internet connection by caching the "heartbeats" locally on the phone and uploading them once the signal returns.

3. Reach & Traffic Source Analysis

Description: Identifies how people found the video (Bhuban Search, External Links, Shorts Feed, or Recommendations).



The Formula (S):



Image_1.png



Innovative Solution: Smart Referrer Tracking. Unlike YouTube, Bhuban can use AI to trace "Social Sentiment." If a video is going viral on Twitter/X, the dashboard should notify the creator: "Your video is being shared by influencers—jump into the comments now!"



4. Advanced Debugging & Error Resolution

Every system will eventually face an error. Here is the Bhuban Debugging Protocol:

A. The "Ghost View" Bug

• Problem: Analytics show 10,000 views, but revenue shows $0.

• Root Cause: Bot traffic or "Click Farms."

• The Fix: Implement User-Behavior Fingerprinting. AI analyzes the mouse movements or touch patterns. If they are too "robotic," the views are flagged and removed from the count.

B. The "Latency Gap"

• Problem: Mobile app shows 500 views, but Desktop shows 450.

• The Fix: Eventual Consistency. Use a "Sync Timestamp." The UI should display: "Last updated 2 minutes ago" to manage user expectations while the backend catches up.

5. My Innovative Thoughts for "Bhuban Creator"

To make your app truly "Great" and "Clear," consider these Next-Gen features:

1. AI Thumbnail Predictor: Before the creator even uploads, the AI scans the thumbnail and says: "This is too dark for your audience. Add 20% more contrast for a 5% higher CTR."

2. Revenue Forecasting: Instead of showing what you made, show what you will make. "Based on current trends, this video will earn $400 by next Friday."

3. One-Click Debugger: A button for creators that says "Fix my Stats." It triggers a manual re-sync between the video player logs and the analytics database to correct any small discrepancies.



The Bhuban Creator Studio: UI & Functional Architecture

1. The "Pulse" Dashboard (Overview Tab)

This is the "at-a-glance" health check for the channel.

• Metric Cards: Large, clear numbers for Total Views, Watch Time (Hours), Subscribers, and Estimated Revenue.

• Real-time 60-Minute Ticker: A live bar chart showing views per minute.

• Function: Provides immediate emotional feedback to a creator after an upload.

• Innovation: "The Trend-line Overlay." Instead of just showing a number, the UI draws a ghost-line of the creator’s previous best video. If the current line is higher, the text turns Golden-Yellow to celebrate the win.

2. The Retention "Story" (Engagement Tab)

• Dynamic Heatmap: A visual timeline of the video.

• Spikes: Highlighted in Pink. These represent "Intro Hooks" or "Key Moments" where people re-watched.

• Dips: Highlighted in Grey. These show "Drop-off Points" where viewers got bored.

• Working Condition: The AI scans the audio at the "Dip" points. If it finds a long silence or repetitive speech, it adds a note: "Try adding background music here next time to maintain energy."

• Bug Fix: If data is missing for a specific segment, the system uses Linear Interpolation to smoothen the graph so it doesn't look broken.

3. Reach & Discovery (The Algorithm Map)

• The Funnel Logic: 1.  Impressions: How many people saw the thumbnail.

2.  CTR (Click-Through Rate): The "Hook" percentage.

3.  Views: The "Entry" count.

• The "Traffic Source" Breakdown: A pie chart showing if views came from Search, Recommendations, or External links (WhatsApp/FB).

• Innovation: "Search Discovery Insights." If a video isn't being found, the AI suggests: "Users are searching for 'How to bake'—your title says 'Cooking Cake.' Change it to 'How to bake a cake' to increase reach by 15%."

4. Audience Demographics (The "Who" Tab)

• Returning vs. New Viewers: A line graph showing loyalty.

• Active Times: A "Heat Calendar" showing exactly when the creator's audience is online.

• Function: A "Schedule" button is placed right next to the peak time to encourage posting when the audience is awake.

• Top Geographies: A world map with Red/Yellow hotspots showing where the fans live.

5. Technical "Fail-Safe" & Debugging Suite

To ensure this app never fails a creator, we include these "Hidden" functions:



My Innovative Thoughts: The "Bhuban Edge"

1. AI Thumbnail A/B Split-Testing:

Instead of guessing, the app allows the creator to upload two thumbnails. For the first 2 hours, it shows Thumbnail A to half the audience and Thumbnail B to the other half. It then automatically selects the one with the highest CTR for the rest of the video's life.

2. "Vibe" Analysis:

The AI listens to the tone of the video. If the creator sounds too sad or too quiet, it suggests: "Your energy level is 3/10. For better retention, try speaking 10% faster in your next intro."

3. Revenue Predictor:

Using the formula Revenue = (Views / 1000) \times CPM, the AI projects earnings based on the video's current speed, helping creators plan their monthly budget.

Final Master Instruction:

For this app to be truly great, use Micro-services. The "Analytics Engine" should be a separate server from the "Video Player." This way, even if 100 million people are watching videos, the Creator can still see their stats without any lag.



🛡️ The Pre-Launch "War Room" Checklist

Before the first creator logs in, your engineering team must pass these four "broad-spectrum" tests.

1. The "Million-User" Spike Simulation (Load Testing)

You must simulate a viral moment. Use a tool like Apache JMeter to create 100,000 "Virtual Creators" all trying to check their analytics at the same time.

• Broad Instruction: Monitor the Latency (Response Time). If the dashboard takes more than 2 seconds to load under this pressure, you must optimize your database indexes immediately.

• The Goal: 99.99% Uptime.

2. The "Dirty Data" Scrub (Integrity Check)

Creators will try to "game" the system. Your AI must be tested against "View Bots."

• Broad Instruction: Feed the system fake traffic data. If the AI doesn't automatically filter out views from the same IP address that last less than 3 seconds, your revenue model is at risk.

• The Solution: Implement a Fraud Detection Layer that cross-references the User-ID with their interaction history.

3. The "Cross-Platform" Sync Test

A creator might upload a video on their Laptop and then immediately check the views on their Phone while in a taxi.

• Broad Instruction: Ensure the Cache-Sync is perfect. If the phone shows 100 views but the laptop shows 105, the creator will lose trust.

• The Solution: Use WebSockets for real-time updates so that every screen "pings" the moment a new view is validated.

🔍 How to Debug "The Impossible" Problems

When things go wrong in a "YouTube-scale" app, the error is rarely in one line of code; it’s usually in the Data Flow.

A. The "Stuck Metric" Mystery

• Scenario: A video is clearly trending on social media, but the Bhuban view count is stuck at "499."

• The Debug Path: Check the Buffer Stream. In high-traffic apps, we often use a "Queue" (like Kafka). If the "Consumer" (the part that writes to the database) is crashed, the data is safe in the queue but not showing on the screen.

• The Fix: Restart the Analytics Worker Service and the views will "flood" in instantly.

B. The "Ghost Revenue" Discrepancy

• Scenario: The watch time is high, but the money is low.

• The Debug Path: Look at the Ad-Insertion Logs. Is the ad-server failing to serve ads to users in a specific country (e.g., Bangladesh or USA)?

• The Fix: Implement a Failover Ad-Network. If the primary ad fails, the AI should instantly swap to a "Backup Ad" so the creator never loses a penny.

💡 My Final Thoughts for a "World-Class" App

To make Bhuban a legend, you must focus on Empowerment through Clarity.

• The "Plain Language" AI: Most creators are artists, not mathematicians. Don't just show a graph. Have the AI write a summary: "Hey! Your intro is amazing, but you lose people when you start talking about the sponsor. Try making the transition smoother next time."

• The "What-If" Simulator: Add a button where a creator can type: "What if I change my title to 'The Secret of Life'?" and the AI predicts: "Based on similar videos, this could increase your search reach by 12% but might lower your retention."

• The "Community Health" Score: Instead of just "Views," show a "Vibe Score." Are the comments positive? Is the community growing? This teaches creators to build a "Family," not just a "Number."





1. The Access "Formula" (OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect)

To log in with Google, Apple, or Facebook, your app uses a standardized "Handshake" protocol.

The Formulation Logic:

1. The Request: Your app sends the user to the provider (e.g., Google) with a Client_ID and a Scope (requesting specific data like email and name).  

2. The Consent: The user logs into Google and clicks "Allow."  

3. The Code Exchange: Google sends a temporary Authorization Code back to your app.

4. The Token: Your backend exchanges that code for an Access Token and an ID Token using a secret key (Client\_Secret).

• Formula: \text{Access Granted} = f(\text{Valid Client ID} + \text{User Consent} + \text{Secure Token Exchange}).

2. Provider-Specific Rules & Requirements

Each platform has its own "Rules of Engagement" that you must follow to avoid being banned.

• Sign in with Apple (SWA): * The "Golden Rule": If you offer Google or Facebook login on an iPhone app, Apple requires you to also offer "Sign in with Apple."

• Privacy: Apple allows users to "Hide My Email," meaning your app will receive a random relay address (e.g., user123@privaterelay.appleid.com) instead of their real one. Your system must be designed to accept these.  

• Google Identity: * Branding Rule: You must use the official "Sign in with Google" button design. You cannot change the colors or the logo font.

• Verification: If your app requests "Sensitive Scopes" (like seeing a user's YouTube history), Google requires a manual security audit of your app.

• Facebook Login: * The "Data Deletion" Rule: You must provide a clear URL in your app settings where users can request that you delete the data you pulled from Facebook.

3. Regulations & Legal Compliance (The Protection Layer)

Because you are handling personal data (Names, Emails, Photos), you are legally bound by international laws.  

• GDPR (Europe) & CCPA (California): You must show a "Privacy Policy" before the user clicks the login button. This policy must state exactly what you will do with their email address.  

• Data Minimization: Only ask for what you need. If your app only needs an email to create an account, do not ask for their "Friends List" or "Birthday."

• Explicit Consent: The login button should ideally have a sub-text: "By clicking Login, you agree to Bhuban’s Terms of Service."

4. Common Problems & The "Formulaic" Solutions

Building this is easy; keeping it running is the hard part.

Problem A: The "Duplicate Account" Headache

• Scenario: A user logs in with Google on Monday, then forgets and logs in with Facebook on Tuesday using the same email.

• The Solution (Account Linking): Your database should use the Email Address as the "Primary Key." If a Facebook login comes in with an email that already exists via Google, the app should say: "You previously used Google to sign in. Would you like to link your Facebook account to this profile?"

Problem B: Token Expiration (The "Kick-Out" Bug)

• Scenario: A creator is mid-upload, and their login session expires, crashing the upload.

• The Solution (Refresh Tokens): Your app must implement Silent Re-authentication. Use a "Refresh Token" to get a new "Access Token" in the background without the user ever seeing a login screen.  

Problem C: The "Disallowed User-Agent" Error

• Scenario: On Android/iOS, if you try to open the Google login page inside a "Webview" (a browser inside your app), Google will block it for security.

• The Solution: Use Native SDKs (Google Sign-In for Android/iOS). This opens the system’s actual browser or the Google App, which is 100% secure.

5. My Innovative Thoughts for a "Great" Experience

To make your login experience better than the rest:

1. The "Guest Preview" Mode: Don't force users to log in immediately. Let them watch 3 videos or browse the feed first. Only ask for a login when they try to "Like," "Comment," or "Upload." This increases your app's "Install-to-User" conversion rate by up to 40%.

2. Passkey Integration: For 2026, move beyond passwords. Allow users to log in using FaceID or Fingerprint (Biometrics). It is faster than social login and more secure.

3. One-Tap Profile Sync: When they log in, automatically pull their Profile Picture and Display Name so their Bhuban profile looks "finished" immediately.



1. The Unified Database Formula

In a professional creator app, you never store social media IDs directly in the main Users table. Instead, you use a Relational Linkage Formula.

The Logic:

• Users Table: Stores the core identity (Unique ID, Email, Display Name, Created Date).

• Social_Identities Table: Stores the connection to the providers (Google, Apple, Facebook).

• The Link: One user can have multiple social identities linked to a single "User_ID."

The Data Structure (Logic-Only):

• User_ID: The master key for the creator.

• Provider_Name: (e.g., "google", "apple", "facebook").

• Provider_User_ID: The unique string given by Google/Apple (this never changes).

• Credential_Hash: A secure, encrypted version of their access token.

2. Access Rules & Regulations (Compliance)

To keep your app on the App Store and Play Store, you must follow these strict regulatory formulations:

A. Apple's "Sign in with Apple" Requirement

If you offer any third-party social login (Google/FB) on an iOS app, Apple legally requires you to provide "Sign in with Apple" as well. It must be placed above or equal to the other buttons.

B. Data Privacy (GDPR & CCPA)

• Rule of Minimum Scope: Only request the email and public_profile. If you ask for their "Friend List" without a valid reason, Google/Facebook will reject your app during the review.

• Right to Erasure: You must provide a "Delete My Account" button. When clicked, the formula must trigger a "Revoke Request" to the social provider to disconnect the app.

C. The "Apple Relay" Rule

Apple allows users to hide their real email. Your app will receive an email like a1b2c3@privaterelay.appleid.com. Your database must treat this as a valid, unique email address.

3. The Formulation Solution: Step-by-Step Flow

This is the "Algorithm" your developers should follow to prevent login errors:

1. Handshake: User clicks "Login with Google."

2. Verification: The provider sends back a JWT (JSON Web Token). Your server must verify the digital signature of this token to ensure it hasn't been faked.

3. The "Check-or-Create" Logic:

• Search the Social_Identities table for the Provider_User_ID.

• If found: Log the user into the existing account.

• If NOT found: Search the Users table for the Email.

• If Email exists: Link this new Social Identity to that existing User_ID (this prevents duplicate accounts).

• If Email does NOT exist: Create a brand new User and then link the identity.

4. Security & Safety Formulation

To ensure your creators' accounts are never hacked via social login:

• State Parameter: Every login request must include a random "State" string to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). If the response doesn't match the state, the login is rejected.

• Token Encryption: Never store Access Tokens in plain text. Use AES-256 Encryption so that even if your database is leaked, the tokens are useless to hackers.

• HTTPS Only: The login "Redirect URI" must strictly be an https:// address. Modern social providers will block http:// connections instantly.

5. My Innovative "Bhuban" Touch

For 2026, don't just offer login. Offer "Social Context Sync":

When a creator logs in with Facebook or Google, the AI should ask: "We see you have 10,000 followers on Facebook. Would you like to automatically invite them to follow your new Bhuban channel?" This turns a simple "Login" into a "Growth Engine."



1. The Revenue Calculation Formula

You must distinguish between Gross Revenue (what advertisers pay) and Net Revenue (what the creator gets).

The Standard Logic:

• Ad-Based Revenue (RPM): This is the "Revenue Per Mille" (per 1,000 views).

• Formula: Net\ Creator\ Pay = (Total\ Ad\ Revenue \times 0.55)

• Note: Historically, the platform takes 45%, and the creator takes 55%.

• The CPM Factor: Not all views are equal. A view from the USA might have a CPM of $15, while a view from a developing market might be $2.

• Deductions: Before paying, the system must subtract "Invalid Traffic" (clicks from bots) and Payment Processing Fees (approx. 2-3%).

2. The Payout Lifecycle (Rules & Scheduling)

A creator shouldn't have to "request" money; it should flow like clockwork.

• The Threshold Rule: Payouts are only triggered once the creator reaches a minimum balance (e.g., $100 or 5,000 BDT).

• The "Net-30" Schedule:

1. Month 1 (Accrual): Revenue is earned and shown as "Estimated" in the dashboard.

2. Day 1-7 of Month 2 (Finalization): The AI scrubs the data for fraud and finalizes the balance.

3. Day 21 of Month 2 (Payout): The money is sent to the creator's bank or wallet.

• The "Hold" Regulation: If a creator gets a Copyright Strike, the system must automatically "Freeze" their payout until the dispute is resolved to prevent paying for stolen content.

3. Integrated Payout Solutions (Wallets & Banks)

Since Bhuban aims to be global yet local, you need a multi-lane "Money Highway."

• Mobile Wallets (Local Speed): Integrate directly with local favorites like bKash, Nagad, or JazzCash. This is essential for small creators who don't have traditional bank accounts.

• Global Standard (Stripe/PayPal): For international creators, use Stripe Connect. It handles the "Heavy Lifting" of moving money across borders.

• Bank Transfer (Swift/SEPA): For high-earning "Power Creators" who prefer direct deposits into business accounts.

4. Regulations & Tax Formulation (The Legal Layer)

In 2026, financial "blind spots" lead to massive fines. Your app must automate the boring parts:

• Tax Documentation (W-8BEN / W-9): The app must collect tax forms before the first payout. If a creator doesn't provide them, the law requires you to withhold 24-30% of their earnings for the government.

• KYC (Know Your Customer): To prevent money laundering, creators must upload a Government ID once they cross a certain earning threshold (e.g., $500).

• Automated Invoicing: For every payout, the system must generate a PDF Invoice that the creator can download for their own tax filings.

5. My Innovative "Bhuban" Financial Edge

1. "Instant Pay" Feature: Instead of waiting 30 days, allow creators to withdraw their earnings instantly for a small "Convenience Fee" (e.g., 1%). This provides them with immediate cash flow for their next production.

2. Creator Investment Fund: Allow creators to "Re-invest" 5% of their earnings directly into Bhuban Ads to promote their own channel, creating a "Self-Sustaining Growth Loop."

3. The "Smart Tax" Reserve: Add a toggle in settings: "Save for Taxes." The app will automatically move 20% of their earnings into a separate "Vault" so they aren't hit with a surprise bill at the end of the year.



1. The Community Guidelines (The "Law of the Land")

Before the code is written, the rules must be clear. Your guidelines should cover four "No-Go" zones:

• Safety First: Zero tolerance for child exploitation, self-harm, or graphic violence.

• Authenticity: No deepfakes without disclosure, no view-botting, and no impersonation of public figures.

• Respect: No "Hate Speech" (attacks based on race, religion, or gender) or targeted cyberbullying.

• Regulated Goods: No illegal sales, firearms promotion, or dangerous medical misinformation.

2. The AI Moderation "Engine" (The Logic Flow)

Your AI doesn't just "watch" a video; it breaks it down into different data streams.

The Multimodal Formulation:

1. Visual Scan (Computer Vision): The AI scans every frame for nudity, weapons, or violent symbols (like hate group logos).

2. Audio Scan (Speech-to-Text): The AI converts audio to text and checks for slurs or threats in over 100 languages (essential for a global platform).

3. Contextual Scan (NLP): It checks the Title, Description, and Tags.

• Example: A video of a boxing match is "Sport" (Allowed), but a video of a street fight with the same visual markers is "Violence" (Banned). The AI uses the text context to decide.

3. The "Three-Tier" Moderation Solution

You cannot just delete everything. You need a nuanced approach to keep the community happy.



4. Regulations: The "Transparency" Formula

In 2026, governments require apps to be transparent about why they ban people.

• The Appeal Formula: If the AI makes a mistake, the user must have a "One-Tap Appeal" button.

• The "Receipt" Rule: When you remove a video, you must send a "Receipt" explaining exactly which rule was broken.

• Wrong: "Your video was removed for being bad."

• Right: "Your video at 02:45 violated our 'Graphic Violence' policy."

• Strike System: Use the "3-Strike" rule.

• Strike 1: 1-week upload ban.

• Strike 2: 2-week upload ban.

• Strike 3: Permanent account deletion.

5. My Innovative "Bhuban" Safety Edge

• The "Deepfake Detector" Label: If your AI detects that a video was generated by a tool like Sora or Veo, it automatically adds a tag: "Digitally Altered Content." This protects your users from being tricked.

• "Vibe Check" Comments: Use AI to detect "Toxic" comment threads. If a video is getting a lot of hate, the AI can "Slow Down" comments, forcing users to wait 60 seconds between posts to cool off.

• Moderator Wellness Logic: For your human staff, the AI should automatically "Blur" the most graphic parts of a video so the humans don't get traumatized while reviewing it.





The Bhuban Full-Scale Architecture Prompt

Role: You are a Senior Systems Architect and Lead Full-Stack Engineer.

Task: Build Bhuban, a high-performance video ecosystem with a Yellow, Pink, and Red aesthetic.

Constraint: All features must be interconnected, scalable, and built for a "Zero-Failure" creator experience.

Phase 1: Identity & Security (The Gateway)

• Authentication Logic: Integrate OAuth 2.0 for Google, Apple, and Facebook.

• Unified ID Formula: Use an Email-as-Primary-Key linkage system. If User_Email exists, link Provider_ID to the existing User_ID to prevent account duplication.

• Regulations: Implement Apple's "Private Relay" compatibility and a GDPR-compliant "Data Erasure" automated request system.

• Security: Enforce AES-256 encryption for session tokens and mandatory HTTPS for all redirect URIs.

Phase 2: The Core Video Engine & UI

• Navigation Architecture: Construct a 5-tier navigation: Home (Weighted Discovery), Shorts (Vertical Buffer-Stream), Upload (Multi-stage validator), Subscriptions, and Profile.

• The "Universe" Feed: Apply the Engagement Formula: E = (V \cdot w_1) + (C \cdot w_2) + (S \cdot w_3) - (D \cdot w_4). Prioritize Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Average View Duration (AVD).

• Player Specs: HLS-based streaming (144p to 8K). Implement background pre-fetching for the next two videos in the feed to achieve zero-latency.

Phase 3: Creator Studio & Advanced Analytics

• The Pulse Dashboard: Build a real-time data pipeline using a "Write-Ahead Log" (WAL) and message queuing (Kafka) to handle high-frequency view pings without database locking.

• Analytical Features:

• Retention Heatmaps: Map frame-by-frame drop-offs and re-watches.

• Traffic Funnels: Visual breakdown of Impressions \rightarrow CTR \rightarrow Views.

• AI Insights: Integrate NLP to suggest title changes and "Content Gaps" based on subscriber search trends.

• Innovative Testing: Build an integrated A/B Thumbnail Tester that auto-selects the winning thumbnail after a 2-hour sample period.

Phase 4: Monetization & Payout Infrastructure

• Revenue Split: Automate a 55/45 split logic. Deduct 3% processing fees and "Invalid Traffic" filters before finalization.

• Payout Engine: Execute a Net-30 cycle with a $100 threshold.

• Integrations: Multi-lane payouts via bKash/Nagad (Local), Stripe (Global), and SWIFT (Bank).

• Tax/KYC: Mandatory W-8BEN/W-9 collection and Identity Verification (KYC) for accounts exceeding earning milestones.

Phase 5: Safety, Moderation & AI Guard

• Multimodal AI: Execute real-time scanning of Video (Visual CV), Audio (Speech-to-Text), and Metadata (NLP).

• The Strike System: A 3-strike automated protocol with "Evidence Receipts" sent to creators.

• Innovative Labels: AI-detection for "Digitally Altered Content" (Deepfakes) and "Vibe-Check" moderation that slows down comment threads during high-toxicity periods.

Phase 6: Resilience & Debugging Protocol

• Deployment: Use Blue-Green deployment to ensure zero downtime during updates.

• Error Handling: Implement "Eventual Consistency" for analytics to manage data-lag, and "Resumable Uploads" for creators with spotty internet.

• Stress Test: Simulate the "Thundering Herd" effect (1M concurrent clicks) using Edge Computing/CDNs to prevent server crashes.

🛡️ Implementation Checklist for the Developer

1. Atomic Design: Build UI components in the Yellow/Pink/Red palette first.

2. Containerization: Use Docker to ensure the "Access Formula" works across all environments.

3. Telemetry: Set up real-time monitoring to watch for "Heartbeat" drops in the server.





1. The Real-Time Error Identification Formula

We move away from passive logs and toward Active Telemetry.

• The "Heartbeat" Formula: Every action (Search, Play, Upload) sends a "Successful Completion" signal (S) to the backend. If the backend sees a "Request" without a corresponding S within a set millisecond threshold, the Sentinel triggers an investigation.

• Error Clustering: Instead of seeing 1,000 individual errors, the AI groups them: "90% of users in Dhaka are experiencing a 404 on Search." This identifies the Root Cause instantly.

2. The "Self-Healing" Solution (The Debugging Logic)

When an error is identified, the system follows a three-step automated recovery:

Step A: The Circuit Breaker (Isolation)

If a specific feature (like the Search bar) starts failing, the Circuit Breaker trips. It prevents the error from spreading to the Video Player. The user sees a "Searching is under maintenance" message instead of the whole app crashing.

Step B: The "Shadow Fix" (Auto-Correction)

• Scenario: A server is overloaded.

• Solution: The AI identifies the "Heavy Traffic" and automatically spins up 5 new virtual servers (Auto-Scaling) and redirects the users.

• Scenario: A code bug is detected in a new update.

• Solution: The system performs an Automated Rollback. It instantly swaps the "Broken" version of the app for the "Last Known Good" version without the user ever knowing.

Step C: Hot-Patching

The system uses "Dynamic Code Injection" to fix small logic errors in the background while the app is still running, so users don't have to download a new update from the App Store.

3. Broad Instructional Step-by-Step for the Full App

This combines all our previous discussions into a master execution flow:

Step 1: The Gateway (Identity & Access)

• User enters via Google/Apple/FB.

• System checks the Unified ID Formula.

• Bhuban Sentinel monitors the login speed; if a social provider is slow, it switches to a backup authentication node.

Step 2: The Experience (Engagement & Video)

• User scrolls the Home Feed. The AI uses the Engagement Score (E) to fetch videos.

• If a video starts buffering, the Sentinel identifies a CDN bottleneck and reroutes the video stream to a faster server path in real-time.

Step 3: The Creator Hub (Analytics & Payouts)

• Creator checks their Retention Heatmap.

• The system uses the Write-Ahead Log to ensure every view is counted.

• Payout Logic: On the 21st, the system executes the 55/45 split. If a bank API is down, the Sentinel queues the payment and retries every 10 minutes until successful.

Step 4: The Shield (Moderation & Safety)

• Every upload is scanned by the Multimodal AI.

• If a "Deepfake" is detected, it is labeled. If "Hate Speech" is found, the 3-Strike Protocol is triggered.

5. My Innovative Thought: The "Silent Fix" Notification

To build massive trust, if a user experiences a bug (like a search error) and your system fixes it in the backend, send them a small, friendly notification 5 minutes later:

"Oops! We noticed a tiny hiccup while you were searching. We’ve polished the gears and everything is smooth now. Happy watching!"
